       "AIMessage(content='Victory Mansions is a building with glass doors that Winston Smith enters. The hallway of the building has a smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. There is a large colored poster on one end of the hallway, depicting the face of a man in his forties with a black mustache. The building has seven flights of stairs, as the lift is often not working due to the electricity being cut off during daylight hours. On each landing, there is a poster with the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.\" Inside the flat, there is a telescreen, an oblong metal plaque that functions as a screen and broadcasts a voice reading out figures related to the production of pig-iron. The flat has a window, and Winston is described as a small and frail figure wearing blue overalls, which are the uniform of the party.')"
